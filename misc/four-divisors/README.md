# Four divisors

## Problem definition

Given a number `N`, determine the number of integers from 1 to N that have exactly 4 divisors.

## Input

An integer `N`, where `1 <= N <= 10^6`.

## Output

A single integer indicating the number of integers from 1 to N that have exactly 4 divisors.

## Example

Sample input:

10

Sample output:

3

Justification:
The interval [1,10] contains 3 integers that have exactly 4 divisors:

* 6  -> 1, 2, 3, 6

* 8  -> 1, 2, 4, 8

* 10 -> 1, 2, 5, 10
